These code are used to quantify insect pollination behavior <br />
StepX are the video processing codes. Videos frames are analyzed to calculate the position of the moth and generate learning curves<br />
M_StepX are the motion processing codes which analyze moth kinematics. Tracked positions are used to elucidate flight parameters of moths trajectories <br /> 
A_X are auxillary codes used for visualization of flight video analysis <br />
P_X are codes to proboscis tip motion <br />
